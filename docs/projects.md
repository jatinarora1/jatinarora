## Theft Detection

[`Theft-Detection`](https://github.com/jatinarora1/Theft-Detection) is an application which can detect 5 things which help in detecting suspicious activity.
The 5 features this application extract from the real-time video are mentioned below:

1.) Motion Detection.

2.) Facial Expression(if a person is not wearing a mask).

3.) Mask Detection.

4.) Weapon Detection.

5.) It generates the caption of the activity that happened in the specific frame.

Using these 5 features a machine learning model is trained which describes the type of activity that happened or going to have happened.

## Face Mask Detector

[`Face-Mask-Detector`](https://github.com/jatinarora1/Face-Mask-Detector) is a machine learning model capable to detect if a person is wearing masks or not with accuracy of 97.8%. This model is trained on 10,000 images and can be used in any kind of device whether mobile or desktop.


## Weapon Detector

[`Weapon-Detector`](https://github.com/jatinarora1/Weapon-Detector) is a machine learning model capable to detect if a person is carrying a deadly weapon with him or not with accuracy of 98.8%. This model is trained on 12,000 images which contain different weapons held in different positions by people with different height and complection. This model can be used in any kind of device whether mobile or desktop. 

## Image Captioning

[`Image-Captioning`](https://github.com/jatinarora1/Image-Captioning) is machine learning model which can predict the captions after processing the image provided to it. This model is has hybrid architecture of LSTM and CNN, where CNN is for image processing and LSTM is for text processing and generation. This model is trained on `flickr32k` dataset and is 88% accurate.



## Emoji Predictor

[`Emoji Predictor`] is a machine learning model which predicts the specific emoji for the text provided to it. This model extracts the sentiments out of the text with 97.8% accuracy.

## Face Detector

[`Face Detector`] is machine learning model which detects the face and gives the specific information stored with the detected face's person.
